# NetworkSimulator
a1 simulate the process of Socket programming in python using datagram sockets (UDP).
The client and server communicate according to the protocol specifications. The protocol consists of four phases. In the first two phases, the client and the server use UDP protocol to communicate and in the last two phases they use TCP protocol for communication. The client and server communicate by sending packets.

a2 simulate a reliable transport protocol
The simulator provides the interface to the application layer (output and deliverData) and the interface provided by the network layer to the transport layer (udt_send, input).
